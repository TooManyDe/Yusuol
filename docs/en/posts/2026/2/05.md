# How is the Chinese Calendar Calculated?

First, determine the exact moments of two consecutive winter solstices.

Count how many new moon moments occur between those two winter solstices (the interval includes the first solstice but excludes the second).

The period between two new moons constitutes one lunar month.The calendar day on which a new moon occurs is designated as the first day of the month.Day boundaries are defined by Beijing Time (UTC+8), with the cutoff at 00:00:00.

Calculate the moments of the principal solar terms (中气), which correspond to the instants when the Earth’s longitude reaches exact multiples of 30° along its orbit.

Check how many new moons occur between the two winter solstices:If there are 12 new moons (forming 11 synodic months plus one extra new moon), no leap month is inserted—even if a month happens to lack a principal solar term.If there are 13 new moons (forming 12 synodic months plus one extra new moon), then examine each month to see whether it contains a principal solar term:If a month has no principal solar term, that month becomes a leap month, and its name is inherited from the previous month.If two months lack a principal solar term, only the first such month is designated as the leap month; the second is not.

In addition, because the Earth moves faster at perihelion and slower at aphelion, and the Moon likewise moves faster at perigee and slower at apogee, the interval between new moons is not constant. It fluctuates roughly between 29.27 and 29.84 days. This variation affects the determination of the first day of each month, giving rise to “long” and “short” months in the calendar.

In a sense, the Chinese calendar is an attempt to solve a perturbed two-body, three-body, or even many-body problem under specific constraints. It requires extremely precise calculations of the exact times of every solar term and every new moon.

Today, responsibility for compiling the Chinese calendar lies with the Purple Mountain Observatory. The calendar is published about a year in advance; the latest release is for 2026. The astronomical data they use are fully aligned with international standards, including Solar System ephemerides from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The modern calendar also inherits traditions dating back to the Xia and Han dynasties, such as the principle of “establishing Yin as the first month” (建寅为正)—that is, designating the Yin month as the first month of the year.

“Establishing Yin” means that the handle of the Big Dipper (the Dǒu bǐng) points toward the Yin position. If we imagine the celestial equator as a great circle divided into the twelve Earthly Branches, the Big Dipper’s handle functions like a pointer. In ancient times, the direction of the handle at dusk was used as the reference.

The winter solstice occurs when the Dipper’s handle points due north, toward the Zi position. Because this is extremely easy to observe, the winter month is designated as the Zi month. Since Yin is defined as the first month, even if a leap month occurs in between—say, a leap winter month—that leap winter month remains a Zi month. Likewise, a leap twelfth month remains a Chou month. This ensures that the Yin month is always the first month.

In terms of hexagrams, the winter solstice corresponds to ䷗, when the first yang energy is born. By the time the calendar reaches the Yin month, the hexagram is ䷊—“three yangs bring great fortune”—an auspicious sign.

If you treat the first month as month one and count forward, you’ll find that the winter solstice always falls in the eleventh month. It may be the twelfth month of a given year in sequence, but it is always the month named “the eleventh month.” For this reason, the eleventh month is also called the winter month. In modern practice, the month containing the winter solstice is directly designated as the eleventh month.

This is easy to understand: there are only twelve Earthly Branches, fixed in number. Counting from Yin to Zi—Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, Hai, Zi—Zi is the eleventh. If the span from one Zi to the next uses up exactly all twelve branches, no leap month is needed. If an extra month appears in between, a leap month must be inserted; otherwise, there wouldn’t be enough branches to assign.

Take the Gui-Chou year (January 31, 2033 – February 18, 2034) as an example. The winter solstice falls on the thirtieth day of the winter month (December 21). The previous winter solstice was on the nineteenth day of the winter month (December 21, 2032). The twelve months in between correspond neatly to the twelve Earthly Branches. Even though the Shen month (the seventh month) lacks a principal solar term, no leap month is inserted.

The next winter solstice falls on the twelfth day of the winter month (December 22, 2034). This time, there are thirteen months in between. If you try to assign them to the twelve Earthly Branches, you’ll find one extra month. The first month after the winter solstice lacks a principal solar term, so it becomes a leap month, inheriting the name of the winter month—a leap winter month. For someone born in a winter month (like me), this may well be the only leap birthday month of a lifetime.

The first month does not have to be the Yin month. The Xia dynasty used Yin as the first month; the Shang dynasty used Chou; the Zhou dynasty used Zi; the Qin dynasty used Hai. Emperor Wu of the Han restored Yin as the first month. Wang Mang, invoking ancient precedent, switched back to Chou. During the Wu Zhou period of the Tang dynasty, Empress Wu Zetian followed Zhou precedent and made Zi the first month.

From the Three Dynasties through Qin, each change moved the calendar one month earlier—a fascinating pattern. The Qin dynasty adopted the Zhuanxu calendar, with Hai as the first month. This aligns intriguingly with Hu Hai’s name and with Hai’s position as both the last of the twelve Earthly Branches and the beginning of the Qin year—neither fully beginning nor fully ending. The Qin began with Hai and perished with a man named Hai.
Changing the calendrical new year was also ritually legitimate. 

As stated in The Book of Rites · Great Tradition:
“When a sage rules the world facing south, he must begin with human affairs. These include establishing standards of weights and measures, reviewing written culture, changing the beginning of the year, altering dress colors, distinguishing insignia, modifying ritual objects, and differentiating clothing. These are the ways by which he brings reform to the people.”

Kong Yingda’s commentary explains:
“‘Changing the beginning of the year’—‘beginning’ refers to the start of the year, and ‘new moon’ to the start of the month. When a ruler comes to power, he demonstrates that things begin anew with him, adopting a new system according to Yin, Chou, or Zi. Zhou used Zi, Shang used Chou, Xia used Yin—this is what ‘changing the beginning’ means. Zhou reckoned the day from midnight, Shang from cockcrow, and Xia from dawn—this is what ‘changing the new moon’ means.”

On “Lunar/Lunisolar New Year” vs. “Chinese New Year”:

<!--Yusuol-->
If you celebrate the New Year according to the Chinese calendar, then it is unquestionably Chinese New Year, because the Chinese calendar is calculated using Beijing Time (UTC+8). Calendars calculated in other time zones may differ, resulting in different New Year dates.
<!--Yusuol-->

“Chinese New Year” is a subset of “Lunar New Year.” Using Lunar New Year or Lunisolar New Year to refer specifically to Chinese New Year is therefore inaccurate.

People in other countries also celebrate lunar New Year. If they follow the Chinese calendar, they are celebrating Chinese New Year. If they follow their own country’s lunar calendar, then they are celebrating that country’s lunar New Year.
