# Energy Consumption and Wealth

The Kardashev Scale is a theoretical framework proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964. It categorizes civilizations into different levels—Type I, II, and III—based on the amount of energy they are able to utilize.

Type I Civilization (Planetary Civilization): Capable of harnessing all the energy available on its home planet (e.g., Earth). Carl Sagan estimated this total power output to be $1 \times 10^{16}$ watts.

Type II Civilization (Stellar Civilization): Capable of harnessing the total energy output of its parent star, potentially through the construction of a Dyson Sphere. Carl Sagan estimated this total power at $1 \times 10^{26}$ watts.

Type III Civilization (Galactic Civilization): Capable of harnessing all the energy of its host galaxy. Carl Sagan estimated this total power at $1 \times 10^{36}$ watts.

Carl Sagan used the values for Type I, Type II, and Type III to interpolate and extrapolate the following formula:

$$
K = \frac{\log_{10} P - 6}{10}
$$

Where $K$ is the Kardashev rating and $P$ is the power in watts.

In 2024, the total power consumption of human society was approximately $2 \times 10^{13}$ watts, with a population of about $8 \times 10^9$. To maintain the current global average standard of living, the per capita power consumption is approximately 2,500 watts.

The per capita energy consumption in the United States is roughly 4.8 times the world average. To provide every person on Earth with the current American standard of living, the total global power output would need to increase significantly; the current total power is clearly insufficient.

According to the Global Wealth Report 2025 published by UBS, by the end of 2024, the Total Global Wealth was approximately $471 trillion. 

The average wealth per adult globally is approximately $84,700, while the median wealth is approximately $8,654. 

In terms of per capita wealth, the average in the United States is approximately $564,000, while in mainland China, it is approximately $76,000.

Directly selecting $85,000 as a personal standard, assume this person lives in China and spends 2,500 RMB per month (for reference, the minimum wage in Beijing is 2,420 RMB), with an exchange rate of 7.

$85,000 \times 7 = 595,000$ RMB

$595,000 \div 2,500 = 238$ months

$238 \div 12 \approx 19.8$ years

Keep in mind that this is based on $85,000, which includes real estate and fixed assets—items that are subject to depreciation.

Rounding this to 20 years, it demonstrates that the total global wealth is far from sufficient to support the world’s population in a long-term life without work, nor can it provide a wealthy lifestyle for everyone on Earth.

In summary, the current total power output of humanity is struggling to support a wealthy standard of living (the average American standard of living), and the total global wealth is also insufficient to allow everyone to lead a wealthy life.
